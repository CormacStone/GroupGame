![Start-Screen mockup](https://github.com/CormacStone/GroupGame/blob/main/docs/MockUps/ssmu.png)
## Basic info:

 * Text Color: 9ca9ac
 * Continue/New Game/Save Data: b1b1b1
 * Settings/Sound button: 4e4e4e
 * Remy's nose: e9b4b4

## Ideas:
So this is basically just an average startscreen, and the background is planning on being like a scrolling countertop scene, or maybe a still frame with remy and the chefs running back and forth. Shouldn't be too hard to implement.
