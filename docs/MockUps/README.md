# Start Screen Mock Up
![Start-Screen mockup](https://github.com/CormacStone/GroupGame/blob/main/docs/MockUps/ssmu.png)
## Basic info:

 * Text Color: 9ca9ac
 * Continue/New Game/Save Data: b1b1b1
 * Settings/Sound button: 4e4e4e
 * Remy's nose: e9b4b4

## Ideas:
So this is basically just an average startscreen, and the background is planning on being like a scrolling countertop scene, or maybe a still frame with remy and the chefs running back and forth. Shouldn't be too hard to implement.




# HUD Mock Up
![HUD mockup](https://github.com/CormacStone/GroupGame/blob/main/docs/MockUps/hudm.png)
## Basic info:

 * Remy Color: 9ca9ac
 * Remy nose: e9b4b4
 * Cheese Outside/Inside: ffe700/c69900
 * Counter Color: 4e4e4e

## Ideas:
The circle in the top, left corner is showing his current state, whether that be hit, neutral, powerup, etc. The cheeses represent his hp, and when it goes down, a cheese is eaten. The main player is remy, and the background and foreground depends on where he is in the game.


# Game Over Screen Mock Up
![GameOverMockUp]()
## Basic Info:

 * Remy nose: e9b4b4
 * Spotlight ground: bebebe
 * Spotlight trail/text on bottom of screen: 101010
 * Text at top of screen: 9ca9ac

## Ideas:
The screen is static, with some sad music. Probably the easiest of the 3 to make overall.
